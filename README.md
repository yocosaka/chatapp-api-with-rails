# Real Time Chat API built with Ruby on Rails

## About the Project

This API was built with Ruby on Rails for using on Real Time Chat App.
It uses Postgresql as the database.

- The database has 3 tables and models: User, Chatroom, Message
  - Users table has 'username' and 'password' columns
  - Chatrooms has 'name' column
  - Messages table is a through table having user_id, chatroom_id, and content columns
  <!-- - To authorize users, this app uses [JWT](https://jwt.io/) and [Rack-cors](https://github.com/cyu/rack-cors) -->

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful is listed in the acknowledgments.

## How to allow the frontend app to interact with this API

1. Go to puma.rb in config/initializers, and rewrite the port from 3000 to 3001 like below:
   e.g. `port ENV.fetch("PORT") { 3001 }`

2. Go to cors.rb in config/initializers, and rewrite the origins path for your frontend path in both local and production

<!-- ## Authentication

- To manage records and items, it needs to log in with a username and a password. Then, you need to include a token, which is issued and passed by logged in, in the header when interacting with this API like below:
`headers: {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
},`
- Plus, to manage items, it needs to log in with the user account with the admin: true
